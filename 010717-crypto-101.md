# Crypto 101: A Gentle Introduction to Cryptography

This is the introduction in what will be a series of articles diving into different types of cryptography, how they work, and what they are used for.  

1. How do we know the government can't listen in on things?
  1. No magic in how it works
  2. Prime number factorization problem as example
    - Easy to multiply two primes, hard to find the two primes multiplied to get a number
  3. Processing power and brute force for cracking encryption
2. Typical uses for Cryptography
   - VPNs
   - Credit card information for eCommerce
   - Digital Rights Management
   - Digital signing to validate text
     - Touch on what authentication is, why it's useful


3. Steps you can take right now to take advantage of encryption for privacy
  - Start using Signal for messaging
  - Use 2-factor authentication (not with SMS!)


- Potentially add glossary for the uninitiated defining bits, bytes, hex, and maybe a few other building block pieces of vocabulary
